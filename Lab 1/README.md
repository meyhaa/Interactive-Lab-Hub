# Staging Interaction

In the original stage production of Peter Pan, Tinker Bell was represented by a darting light created by a small handheld mirror off-stage, reflecting a little circle of light from a powerful lamp. Tinkerbell communicates her presence through this light to the other characters. See more info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker_Bell). 

There is no actor that plays Tinkerbell--her existence in the play comes from the interactions that the other characters have with her.

For lab this week, we draw on this and other inspirations from theatre to stage interactions with a device where the main mode of display/output for the interactive device you are designing is lighting. You will plot the interaction with a storyboard, and use your computer and a smartphone to experiment with what the interactions will look and feel like. 

_Make sure you read all the instructions and understand the whole of the laboratory activity before starting!_



## Prep

### To start the semester, you will need:
1. Set up your own Github "Lab Hub" repository to keep all you work in record by [following these instructions](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/blob/2021Fall/readings/Submitting%20Labs.md).
2. Set up the README.md for your Hub repository (for instance, so that it has your name and points to your own Lab 1) and [learn how to](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) organize and post links to your submissions on your README.md so we can find them easily.
3. (extra: Learn about what exactly Git is from [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F).)

### For this lab, you will need:
1. Paper
2. Markers/ Pens
3. Scissors
4. Smart Phone -- The main required feature is that the phone needs to have a browser and display a webpage.
5. Computer -- We will use your computer to host a webpage which also features controls.
6. Found objects and materials -- You will have to costume your phone so that it looks like some other devices. These materials can include doll clothes, a paper lantern, a bottle, human clothes, a pillow case, etc. Be creative!

### Deliverables for this lab are: 
1. Storyboard
1. Sketches/photos of costumed device
1. Any reflections you have on the process
1. Video sketch of the prototyped interaction
1. Submit the items above in the lab1 folder of your class [Github page], either as links or uploaded files. Each group member should post their own copy of the work to their own Lab Hub, even if some of the work is the same from each person in the group.

### The Report
This README.md page in your own repository should be edited to include the work you have done (the deliverables mentioned above). Following the format below, you can delete everything but the headers and the sections between the **stars**. Write the answers to the questions under the starred sentences. Include any material that explains what you did in this lab hub folder, and link it in your README.md for the lab.

## Lab Overview

Labs are due on Mondays. Make sure this page is linked to on your main class hub page.

## Part A. Plan 

\*\***Describe your setting, players, activity and goals here.**\*\*
To stage the interaction with your interactive device, factors to consider:

_Setting:_ A home where Lisa, a formal caregiver, is taking care of her client, John, at night. John is in his bedroom sleeping for most of the night. Lisa is either right outside his bedroom or around the house. 


_Players:_ Lisa is the primary player as the nighttime caregiver with John being a secondary player. John lives by himself at home so 

_Activity:_ Although this is Lisa's job, this is a stressfull situation for Lisa. She stays up all night, on high alert, listening for any clues which may indicate John has woken up from his sleep and needs help: sounds of Johnn moving around, turning on a light, walking, etc... Lisa relies on sound and action based clues as she does not want to disturb John's sleep by comming into the bedroom when possible. This device helps ease the burden on Lisa by passively detects John throughout the night and lighting up when John has woken up. This 


_Goals:_ John's family hired Lisa for safety purposes as they cannot be there at night to help John. Lisa wants to be aware of when John is not sleeping and may need assistance. John wants to continue to live at home, as independently as possible; but he may need assistance throughout the night: .   


Sketch a storyboard of the interactions you are planning. It does not need to be perfect, but must get across the behavior of the interactive device and the other characters in the scene. 

\*\***Include a picture of your storyboard here**\*\*
![Image of Storyboard Version 1](https://github.com/meyhaa/Interactive-Lab-Hub/blob/Fall2021/Lab%201/storyboard_v1.jpg)


Present your idea to the other people in your breakout room. You can just get feedback from one another or you can work together on the other parts of the lab.

I presented my idea to Rohan Reddy, Saurav Panda, and Shenxin Jiang. Feedback received:
* A multimodal interaction, such as the phone vibrating, may also be helpful. 
* Future work could incorporate more ways for John to interact with the system, beyond the automatic detection of his actions. This could include a big button on John's side table/bathroom/other key places for him to press when he needs help, in addition to the current interaction. 
* Different types of flashing lights or colors in more devices and/or areas around the house. For example, if Lisa is in the kitchen, there could be another light feedback system there indicating John's safety status. 


## Part B. Act out the Interaction

Try physically acting out the interaction you planned. For now, you can just pretend the device is doing the things you’ve scripted for it. 

\*\***Are there things that seemed better on paper than acted out?**\*\*
* There are a multitude of action that could occur: client moving around, sitting up but not getting out of bed, not needing help, etc... But the light interaction doesn't facilitate for communicating such nuances. However, the light interaction was able to be staged for the one action of the client getting up out of bed. 

\*\***Are there new ideas that occur to you or your collaborators that come up from the acting?**\*\*
* New idea: what if caregiver goes to kitchen

## Part C. Prototype the device

I was not able to fully troubleshoot the Tinkerbelle tool for staging this interaction. Thus, I opted to leverage other means of changing the lights: smart lights and zoom screen sharing. 


## Part D. Wizard the device
\*\***Include your first attempts at recording the set-up video here.**\*\*

Here is my first attempt at staging the interaction with smart lights. 

## Part E. Costume the device
n/a since I did not use my phone with the Tinkerbelle tool.


## Part F. Record

\*\***Take a video of your prototyped interaction.**\*\*
Video for the first iteration of this staged interaction can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DWvN_szDh4go8i45v5cYj-FrFcgGJjQn/view?usp=sharing)

\*\***Please indicate anyone you collaborated with on this Lab.**\*\*
Be generous in acknowledging their contributions! And also recognizing any other influences (e.g. from YouTube, Github, Twitter) that informed your design. 
I collaborated with Rohan Reddy, who graciously let me use his kitchen with smart lights to film! 


# Staging Interaction, Part 2 

This describes the second week's work for this lab activity.


## Prep (to be done before Lab on Wednesday)

\*\***Summarize feedback from your partners here.**\*\*

My idea was first reviewed by Donal Michael Thomas Lowsley-Williams and Ken He on Canvas; Sara Wang provided additional feedback during classtime. Feedback received: 
* Most common feedback: John, the client, should also be able to interact with the system. 
   - Large button for the client to indicate (1) they don't need help OR (2) when they need help
   - Client should be able to interact with the system even if they are not able to get up which would trigger the automatic alert 
   - This button can also function as a phone or call line between the client and caregiver. 
* Other suggestions:
   - Wearable version for caregiver -- "light-emitting device as a wristband"
   - Incorporate more than one type of light based interaction (i.e blinking vs static light) 

## Make it your own
## Updates


Do last week’s assignment again, but this time: 
1) It doesn’t have to (just) use light, 
2) You can use any modality (e.g., vibration, sound) to prototype the behaviors! Again, be creative!
3) We will be grading with an emphasis on creativity. 

For Part 2 of this lab, I focused on also incorporating the client into the interaction system. Thus, the activity involved has expanded to include John.
